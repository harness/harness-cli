# Harness CLI 

The `harness` CLI utility allows users to manage Harness entities through the use of resource YAML files for creating, deleting, and modifying them. Currently, it is primarily focused on the entities required for the CD & GitOps module, with future plans to expand its support to other modules.

- Uses public [Harness REST APIs](https://apidocs.harness.io/)
- Requires a [Harness API Key](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/user-management/add-and-manage-api-keys/) for authenticating with your Harness account.
